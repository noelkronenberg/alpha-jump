## Playing

> **Note:** [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) version 22.0.1 should be installed on the computer.

1. start server: ```python game-server/server.py```
2. if not up to date, generate new ```.exe```
    1. temporarily remove ```test``` folder
    2. generate ```.jar```: ```mvn clean package```
    3. generate ```.exe``` using [Launch4j](https://genuinecoder.com/online-converter/jar-to-exe/)
3. start AI: ```jump-sturdy-ai/GruppeC_KI.exe```
4. start other AI (can be another instance of ```jump-sturdy-ai/GruppeC_KI.exe```)
5. wait for game to end
6. stop execution of ```GruppeC_KI.exe``` (e.g. via Task Manager)
